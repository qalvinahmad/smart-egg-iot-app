Project Description

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) based application designed to monitor and manage a chicken coop for laying hens automatically. By using IoT devices such as temperature and humidity sensors, and food flow controllers, this application helps farmers monitor the coop and laying hens' conditions in real-time.

This application includes:

Monitoring of temperature and humidity levels in the coop
Scheduling of feeding times
Monitoring of hen health (through additional sensors that can be added)
Egg production reporting
Note: This project uses simulated data for demonstration purposes. All data used in this application is fictional and does not reflect real-world data. To avoid any exposure of sensitive information, no actual data is included in this repository.

Key Features

Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Automatically monitor and control the temperature and humidity of the chicken coop.
Feeding Schedule Management: Schedule and control the feeding system for the hens.
Hen Health Monitoring: Surveillance of hen health based on certain sensors (e.g., motion sensors or body temperature sensors for the hens).
Real-time Dashboard: User interface display to view the system status in real time.
Usage Instructions

Prerequisites
Platform: This application is designed for use with devices like Arduino and ESP32.

Ideal Coop Temperature: Set the desired temperature range for the chicken coop.
Ideal Humidity: Set the preferred humidity range for the hens.
Feeding Schedule: Set the feeding times for the hens.
Security and Sensitive Data

This project uses simulated data that does not include real-world information about the hens or the actual coop conditions. All data used is for testing and demonstration purposes only.

To prevent any exposure of sensitive information, no personal or business-related data is included in this repository. If you intend to use this application in a real-world environment, please ensure that data is secured and follow applicable security guidelines.
